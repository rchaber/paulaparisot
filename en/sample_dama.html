				<h2>Sample</h2>

				<h3>The Lady of Solitude</h3>

				<h4 style="clear: none; float: left; margin-top: 0">The Umbrella</h4>

				<h6 style="clear: none; float: right; margin-top: 8px;">Translated by Cliff Landers</h6>

				<p style="clear: both;">She opened the letter:</p>
				<p>Giselle, I have to tell you exactly how everything happened. Please understand, I absolutely don’t want to hurt you. I didn’t seek out that woman. I didn’t need or want to get involved with anyone else. I met her by accident.</p>
				<p>It was raining. A woman was walking beside me. You know, Giselle, how I am, I immediately offered her shelter under my umbrella. I told her I was going to the bar at the corner to have some coffee. She replied that it was an incredible coincidence, because she was heading there for the same reason.</p>
				<p>She insisted on paying for the coffee to thank me for my kindness. I refused, saying it was an outdated feminist attitude. She laughed. My name is Charlotte. And mine is Werther, I answered, shaking her hand.</p>
				<p>I noticed a flash in her dark eyes. She laughed and said, but I’m not going to make you suffer like in the book. What time are you coming here for coffee tomorrow? At four, and my name is Joseph. We left the bar together and she told me she didn’t have an umbrella and had even stopped buying them because she would always lose them the same day. She also said she had become accustomed to getting rained on and even enjoyed it. I’m just the opposite, I replied, I hate getting wet and, not meaning to brag, I can say I have more than thirty umbrellas of every kind, English, Italian, French, even those Chinese ones they sell on street corners when it’s raining. We said goodbye, she got into a taxi and left.</p>
				<p>I went back to the office, and I confess that for some reason she had become indelible in my mind, perhaps her eyes, or her lips, or the sound of her voice. I anxiously awaited the next day to meet her again. That’s how it all began, Giselle. To think that I only read Goethe’s book at your insistence.
				The next day I arrived fifteen minutes early. She was on time. While we drank coffee, she asked me, don’t you think we ought to go someplace where we could be more comfortable? Where, what place? I answered. A motel, for example, she said with total candor. I confess that her frankness and simplicity surprised and enchanted me. I’ve always hated hypocritical, duplicitous people, and there in front of me was this beautiful woman who was the exact opposite of that. I forgot about the patients waiting for me at the office and didn’t even call my secretary. Me of all people, Giselle, who was always extremely rigorous about commitments.</p>
				<p>We took a cab and went to the nearest motel. I was more tense than Charlotte was and don’t remember exactly what happened on our first encounter. I know we made love. She left before me, kissed me and said she’d meet me at the bar the next day. I lay stretched out in the bed, remembering her naked body in the mirror on the ceiling.</p>
				<p>Again I arrived fifteen minutes early and Charlotte was on time. Over coffee she said, you know, the second time is always better. I called my secretary and asked her to cancel my afternoon appointments.</p>
				<p>The second time really was better. Charlotte asked for the number of my cell phone. She didn’t want to give me hers, and I didn’t insist. We set up another coffee date. I asked my secretary to cancel appointments with my afternoon patients, explaining that I’d only work during the morning. Don’t ask me why I did it. I don’t know.</p>
				<p>Charlotte was very discreet in relation to her private life. I knew nothing about her, but she knew everything about me. She never asked me anything, but I told her I was a doctor, general practitioner, married, I spoke about you, about our daughter Maria, the university where I took my degree, the soccer team I root for. She knew everything about me and I knew nothing about her. Not even where she was born, where she lived, her last name, nothing.</p>
				<p>At each meeting she became more intense and I responded in the same fashion. My soul was flooded with euphoria when I felt her presence, I would enter into harmony with the world. At such moments I would stop being me, a forty-year-old man, bourgeois, a family man, and become the other person I always wanted to be, a free man. Only at her side could I achieve that state of happiness. If I knew how to bare my soul, dear Giselle, maybe you’d be able to understand me. Do you remember the day I threw all the</p>
				<p>umbrellas in the trash, saying that I wanted to be rained on? That was the beginning of my transformation, when I became another man. I no longer had any control over my actions. And don’t think, Giselle, that it was easy to admit to myself that I could do nothing to overcome the external forces that were taking control of me. Our stable and tranquil life, which I had always thought ideal, revealed itself to be a great deception. I fled the boredom by working, leaving the house earlier and earlier and returning later and later, and I not only escaped the tedium but also made more money to fulfill my role as provider. I was wasting my life. But we can’t live deceiving ourselves, a moment comes when reality proves itself to be unbearable. Giselle, forgive me for saying this, but I detested, without realizing it, your perfection, your sensible words. I hated our home. I couldn’t stand our bourgeois friends, with their country houses, new automobiles, and their wives on diets, working out at fitness centers and bleaching their hair. Maybe that’s why I stopped making love to you.</p>
				<p>Whenever I kissed Charlotte I would become excited, even if we had made love just minutes before. When I achieved orgasm, I would suffer a kind of loss of my senses, which would last I don’t know how long, with Z-shaped scintillations flashing in my field of vision. I liked doing everything with her. Before oral sex, I would contemplate her pubis covered with hair. Charlotte didn’t depilate, and that thick dark cluster created a dazzling contrast with her snowy skin. She was closed, like a safe, which I began to open with my tongue, and from her came a pleasant aroma that excited me even more. I stuck my tongue in deeper and eagerly sipped a liquid that was pure nectar to me. Then she would come in my mouth, screaming with pleasure. Afterward, I would penetrate her with my penis and her vagina was so tight that my member would be chafed after we had copulated for a few hours. On other occasions we would practice anal intercourse, very carefully, and after some time I managed to get my penis all the way inside her. Later I would lick her anus and feel surprise that such a minuscule fissure could be penetrated and still remain unscathed. I would bite Charlotte, but my real wish was to rip off a piece of her flesh and eat it. When we were exhausted from so much love, lying prostrate in bed, I would put my middle finger in Charlotte’s vagina, then take it out, put it in my mouth and suck it. Then Charlotte would kiss me and we’d begin everything all over again.</p>
				<p>Nevertheless, it wasn’t just sex. We would listen to music – classical, popular, opera, jazz, read poetry to each other, and prose too. I read to her in bed the Werther that you gave me. I cried, because she was my Charlotte.</p>
				<p>My absolute need to unveil the mystery that surrounded her made me hire a private detective to spy on her. I don’t know whether or not she realized she was being watched. What’s for certain is that she constantly threw the detective off the scent. He told me that Charlotte would get into a taxi and he would take another one to follow her, then suddenly on a two-way street she would jump out of the taxi and grab another one going in the opposite direction. The detective would lose sight of her. She would enter buildings with rear doors and by the time the detective realized what was happening, it was too late. He never saw her with another person; he kept his camera at the ready, to no avail. He swore that Charlotte knew she was being watched, despite his alternating in the task with a colleague. That couldn’t be a coincidence.</p>
				<p>Unsatisfied with the detective’s information, I decided to secretly follow her myself, after one of our encounters. The very first day, Charlotte caught me. She turned a corner, I went after her, furtively, hugging the wall of a building, when I found myself face to face with her, and she asked brusquely, are you following me, you fool? I was embarrassed at having been discovered and also at being called a fool.</p>
				<p>Giselle, you must find it strange that in a letter of this importance I refer to such an irrelevant incident, but it was from that moment that I began to fear losing her forever. Charlotte took two weeks to call me. I couldn’t sleep or eat anymore, and I started drinking. Do you remember? I stopped going to the office all that time, I had gastric problems and got a stomach ulcer. I kept the cell phone in my hand for fear of not hearing it ring. She only called me from a blocked number, which kept me from calling her back. Finally, Charlotte called and we set up a meeting for the following week.</p>
				<p>Then I made the decision I thought was best. I sold that apartment we had rented out, claiming that I wanted to invest the money in high-return stocks, and asked you to sign the sales deed too. I took the money, went to a jewelry store and bought a diamond ring. As soon as I saw Charlotte, I knelt at her feet and said in a choked voice, with tears in my eyes, Charlotte, marry me, I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I gave her the little box with the diamond ring. She looked at the ring and burst out laughing. She</p>
				<p>said, Joseph, are you crazy? What we have is a fling. Besides which, I’m married and love my husband. This is just a weekly diversion, like going to the movies. Joseph, forgive my saying this, but you’re boring me, now you’ve taken to crying and I can’t stand a man who cries. Charlotte then stopped laughing and said, very seriously: Another thing, I don’t want to see you again.</p>
				<p>I begged, sobbing, Charlotte, for the love of God, don’t leave me. She patted me on the head as if I were a dog, turned her back, and left. I never saw her again. I lost the will to live.</p>
				<p>Giselle, I ask forgiveness of you and our daughter for my act, but life without Charlotte is impossible. The box beside this letter contains the diamond ring that she refused. Goodbye, Joseph.</p>
				<p>Giselle tore up the letter, threw the wadded-up pieces into the toilet and flushed it, several times. It was the end of the story. She didn’t look at Joseph’s dead body for a long time. She stood there contemplating the diamond ring.</p>
